            <p>On March 28, 2025, Pisto’s Lounge in Gugulethu NY112 was the place to be as Siqhamo Media’s Kasi Comedy Night turned the spot into a laughter factory! The vibe was electric, the drinks were flowing, and the crowd was ready for a night of pure kasi hilarity, hosted by the dynamic duo, Khaya Mdakaa and Kali Spirit, who kept the energy higher than a Gugulethu braai on Heritage Day.</p>
            <p>First up, Mbulelo Msongelwa hit the stage, dropping jokes about township life so spot-on, we all checked our pockets to see if he’d been spying on us! From dodgy spaza shop deals to the art of dodging your landlord, Mbulelo had the room in stitches. Then came Keenan Cerf, whose sharp wit and slick delivery had us laughing so hard, someone nearly spilled their umqombothi. He roasted everything from load-shedding schedules to WhatsApp group admin drama—relatable much?</p>

            <p>KG, the comedy heavyweight, took it to another level, weaving tales of kasi survival with punchlines that hit like a perfectly timed taxi hoot. The crowd was roaring, and we’re pretty sure the neighbors heard us three streets away. Closing the night was Uncle Thobz, the uncle we all wish we had, spinning stories of family gatherings gone wrong and why his airtime always disappears faster than a R5 coin at a dice game. His set was so funny, even the bar staff forgot to pour drinks for a minute!</p>
            <p>Hosts Khaya Mdakaa and Kali Spirit were the glue that held this comedy chaos together, cracking jokes between sets and hyping the crowd like they were born for the mic. Pisto’s Lounge was buzzing with laughter, good vibes, and that unmistakable Gugulethu spirit. Siqhamo Media’s Kasi Comedy Night proved once again why it’s the heart of township comedy—until the next one, we’ll be chuckling at the memories!</p>
